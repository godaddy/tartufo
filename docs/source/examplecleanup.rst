If the other documentation left you wondering what to do with the results of
your scans, and unsure how to get rid of those pesky leaked secrets, then look
no further!

End-to-End Example
------------------

An End-to-End example walkthrough of a ``tartufo`` scan and the process of
purging the dirty evil passwords that somehow ended up in your code commits. We
will use an additional tool: ``BFG`` (https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/.
More on this later!)

.. note:: OPTIONAL Development only: Setup poetry if you want to use the most
   recent non-released build from github (may not be stable)

   This project uses `Poetry`_ to manage its dependencies and do a lot of the
   heavy lifting. So you'll need to clone the tartufo repo and setup poetry!


   .. code-block:: console

      git clone git@github.com:godaddy/tartufo.git

   Development Use Only Poetry Setup: `Setting up a development environment <CONTRIBUTING.html#setting-up-a-development-environment>`_

#. Clone your repo!

   Select and clone the repo you want to run tartufo on

   .. code-block:: console

      # Clone your repo, variables used later:
      GITHUBPROJECT="yourproject"
      GITHUBREPO="myrepo.git"
      GITHUBADDRESS="github.com"
      git clone --mirror git@${GITHUBADDRESS}:${GITHUBPROJECT}/${GITHUBREPO}

#. Use ``tartufo`` to scan your repository and find any secrets in its history!

   Scan your repo!

   .. code-block:: console

      # Run Tartufo on your repo and create a list of high entropy items to remove:
      tartufo --regex --json scan-local-repo ${GITHUBREPO} | \
          jq -r '.found_issues[].matched_string' | \
          sort -u > remove.txt

   Now you have a "bad password" file! Take a look through it, see if anything
   is wrong. This file will be used by ``BFG`` to replace these flagged "bad
   password" entries with ``***REMOVED***``.

   .. note::

      It is important that you read through this file to make sure there are not
      exceptions that you want to remove and exclude with tartufo! Read more
      about configuring exclusions here: :ref:`configuring-exclusions`

#. Cleanup repo using ``BFG`` and the above remove.txt file

   There's a very slick tool designed to clean up git commit history called
   `BFG`_. By default, ``BFG`` doesn't modify the contents of your latest commit
   on your master (or 'HEAD') branch, even though it will clean all the commits
   before it. This of course means if you have active code with "bad passwords",
   ``tartufo`` will still fail. But let's take the bulk of the old entries out
   first.

   .. code-block:: console

      # Cleanup with BFG
      wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg/1.13.0/bfg-1.13.0.jar
      # Make a backup
      cp -r ${GITHUBREPO} backup_${GITHUBREPO}
      java -jar bfg-1.13.0.jar --replace-text remove.txt ${GITHUBREPO}

#. Uh Oh!

   Occasionally the results will be too big to process all at once. If that
   happens, simply split up the results and loop through them.

   .. code-block:: console

      # occasionally the results will be to big to process all at once
      split -l 200 remove.txt
      for f in x*; do java -jar bfg-1.13.0.jar --replace-text $f ${GITHUBREPO}; done

#. Proceed with cleanup/audit

   Now you have removed the low hanging fruit, it's time to look at the tough
   stuff

   .. code-block:: console

      # run tartufo again to check for any remaining potential secrets
      leftovers=`tartufo --regex -od ~/temp scan-local-repo ${GITHUBREPO}`
      tmppath=`echo -e "$leftovers" | tail -n1 | awk '{print $6}'`
      # look through the remaining strings
      # if there's anything that looks like it shouldn't be there, dig into it and clear it out
      cat ${tmppath}/* | jq '. | " \(.file_path) \(.matched_string) \(.signature)"' | sort -u

#. Take a good look at the output of the above, make sure there are no secrets
   or other sensitive data remaining.

   Now you are going to exclude the signatures for the remaining items (which
   you have verified are non-risk)

   .. code-block:: console

      # now you are ready to ignore those webhook urls:
      cat ${tmppath}/* | jq -r '.signature' | sort -u > allsignatures.txt
      sed -i -e 's/$/\",/g' -e 's/^/  \"/g' allsignatures.txt
      linestr=`grep -n 'exclude-signatures = \[' tartufo.toml`
      line=`echo $linestr | cut -d ":" -f 1`
      line=$(($line+1))
      { head -n $(($line-1)) tartufo.toml; cat allsignatures.txt; tail -n +$line tartufo.toml; } > tartufo.toml_new
      mv tartufo.toml tartufo.toml_bak
      mv tartufo.toml_new tartufo.toml
      # one final run to make sure your signatures are all set
      tartufo --regex scan-local-repo ${gitrepo}

#. Once you are happy with the data that is being stored, time to commit the
   changes back up!

   .. important::

      This does a force push, effectively rewriting the history of your git
      repository!

      After doing this, you will want to be absolutely certain that
      all users who have previously cloned this repository pull down a fresh
      clone in order to prevent re-introducing the former bad history.

   .. code-block:: console

      cd ${GITHUBREPO}
      git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
      git push


#. Danger Will Robinson, Danger!

   You MAY get an error (example error below). If so, keep reading!

   .. code-block:: console

   If you get the above error, it might actually be okay; simply re-run ``tartufo``
   from your main branch. Only continue with the below steps if there are
   results that are not clean. Please note, this solution will remove PR history
   (but not commit history):

   .. code-block:: console

      # create a new blank repo, put the name below
      NEWGITHUBREPO="my-repo-tartufoized.git"
      cd ../
      rm -rf ${GITHUBREPO}
      # Create a bare clone of the repository.
      git clone --bare git@${GITHUBADDRESS}:${GITHUBPROJECT}/${GITHUBREPO}
      # Mirror-push to the new temporary repository
      cd ${GITHUBREPO}
      git push --mirror git@${GITHUBADDRESS}:${GITHUBPROJECT}/${NEWGITHUBREPO}
      cd ..
      rm -rf ${GITHUBREPO}
      # bare clones are missing data, it is easier to re-clone the repo now that it does not have PRs
      git clone git@${GITHUBADDRESS}:${GITHUBPROJECT}/${NEWGITHUBREPO}
      # Now run bfg
      java -jar bfg-1.13.0.jar --replace-text remove.txt ${NEWGITHUBREPO}
      cd ${NEWGITHUBREPO}
      git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
      git push
      # re-run tartufo on new repo
      tartufo --regex -od ~/temp scan-remote-repo git@${GITHUBADDRESS}:${GITHUBPROJECT}/${NEWGITHUBREPO}
      # should have very little (if any) output. check the newly outputed results in the given tmp folder
      ls ~/temp/tartufo-scan-results-/ | wc -l

**Done!**
