=============
Configuration
=============

``tartufo`` has a wide variety of options to customize its operation available
:doc:`on the command line<usage>`. Some of these options, however, can be a bit
unwieldy and lead to an overly cumbersome command. It also becomes difficult to
reliably reproduce the same command in all environments when done this way.

To help with these problems, ``tartufo`` can also be configured by way of a
configuration file!

You can `tell tartufo what config file to use
<usage.html#cmdoption-tartufo-config>`__ by specifying one or more configuration
files on the command line. Paths specified using --config are interpreted
relative to the current working directory.Each file is located and processed in order.
When conflicting directives are provided in different files, the value in the last
file processed takes precedence. List-valued directives (such as
``exclude-path-patterns``) that are present in multiple files are concatenated.

.. _configuration-discovery:

Configuration Discovery
-----------------------

By default, ``tartufo`` will look for a configuration file in the scan target
repository or folder. It looks first for ``tartufo.toml``, and if that does not
exist, then ``pyproject.toml``. The latter is searched for as a matter of
convenience for Python projects, such as ``tartufo`` itself. This file must
exist in the repository root directory (or target folder). The discovered
configuration file will be processed after configuration files specified on the
command line, unless it was also specified on the command line -- in which case,
it will not be read a second time.

Therefore, while normally a target's configuration file will override settings
specified using ``--config`` on the command line, this behavior can be overridden
by specifying the target's configuration explicitly first, and then the desired
"master" configuration second.

Consider:

.. code-block:: shell

   tartufo --config myconfig.toml scan-local-repo .

``tartufo`` will look for ``myconfig.toml`` in the current directory, and then look for
either ``tartufo.toml`` or (if not found) ``pyproject.toml`` in the current
directory because that is the target of the scan. Directives in, say,
``tartufo.toml`` would supersede settings in ``myconfig.toml``.

For purposes of this scan, empty files are considered not to exist.

However:

.. code-block:: shell

   tartufo --config tartufo.toml --config myconfig.toml scan-local-repo .

will cause ``tartufo`` to read ``tartufo.toml`` in the current directory
(assuming it exists), and then ``myconfig.toml``
as above, and then either ``tartufo.toml`` or ``pyproject.toml`` in the current
directory (only) because that is the target of the scan.

If ``tartufo.toml`` exists in the current directory, the effect is that
``tartufo.toml`` is read first, ``myconfig.toml`` is read second (possibly
overriding directives), and ``tartufo.toml`` is not read again because it was
processed already (and any ``pyproject.toml`` is ignored because ``tartufo.toml``
was found).

If any file specified by `--config` doesn't exist, tartufo will raise an error and exit.

**Note**: This behavior is not applicable to remote repository scans, because the
remote repository will be cloned to a scratch directory and neither that directory
nor the configuration files within it are available to specify with ``-config``.

.. _configuration-processing:

Configuration Processing
------------------------

Within each configuration file, ``tartufo`` will look for a section labeled
``[tool.tartufo]`` to find its configuration. This file must be
written in the `TOML`_ format, which should look mostly familiar if you have
dealt with any other configuration file format before.

When the same options appear in multiple files, single-valued options (such as
booleans) will be set by the last processed file. List-valued options will be
concatenated to form a longer list.

All command line options can be specified in the configuration file, with or
without the leading dashes, and using either dashes or underscores for word
separators. When the configuration is read in, this will all be normalized
automatically. For example, the configuration for ``tartufo`` itself looks like
this:

.. code-block:: toml

   [tool.tartufo]
   repo-path = "."
   regex = true
   entropy = true
   exclude-path-patterns = [
    {path-pattern = 'poetry\.lock'},
    {path-pattern = 'pyproject\.toml'},
    # To not have to escape `\` in regexes, use single quoted
    # TOML 'literal strings'
    {path-pattern = 'docs/source/(.*)\.rst'},
   ]
   exclude-signatures = [
       {signature = "62f22e4500140a6ed959a6143c52b0e81c74e7491081292fce733de4ec574542"},
       {signature = "ecbbe1edd6373c7e2b88b65d24d7fe84610faafd1bc2cf6ae35b43a77183e80b"},
   ]

Note that all options specified in a configuration file are treated as
defaults, and will be overridden by any options specified on the command line.

For a full list of available command line options, check out the :doc:`usage`
document.

.. _exclude-signatures:

Excluding Signatures
--------------------

You might see the following header in the output for an issue:

.. image:: _static/img/issue-signature.png

Looking at this information, it's clear that this issue was found in a test
file, and it's probably okay. Of course, you will want to look at the actual
body of what was found and determine that for yourself. But let's say that this
really is okay, and we want tell ``tartufo`` to ignore this issue in future
scans. To do this, you can add it to your config file.

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.tartufo]
    exclude-signatures = [
        {signature = "2a3cb329b81351e357b09f1b97323ff726e72bd5ff8427c9295e6ef68226e1d1", reason = "reason for exclusion"},
    ]


.. _limiting-scans-by-paths:

Limiting Scans by Path
----------------------
You can include or exclude paths for scanning using
Python Regular Expressions (regex) and the `--include-path-patterns` and
`--exclude-path-patterns` options.

.. warning::

   Using include patterns is more dangerous, since it's easy to miss the
   creation of new secrets if future files don't match an existing include
   rule. We recommend only using fine-grained exclude patterns instead.

.. code-block:: toml

   [tool.tartufo]
   include-path-patterns = [
      {path-pattern = 'src/', reason='reason for inclusion'},
   ]
   exclude-path-patterns = [
      {path-pattern = 'poetry\.lock', reason='reason for exclusion'},
   ]


Configuration File Exclusive Options
------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.0

As of version 3.0, we have added several configuration options which are
available only in the configuration file. This is due to the nature of their
construction, and the fact that they would be exceedingly difficult to
represent on the command line.

.. _rule-patterns:

Rule Patterns
+++++++++++++

.. versionadded:: 3.0

``tartufo`` comes bundled with a number of regular expression rules that it will
check your code for by default. If you would like to scan for additional regular
expressions, you may add them to your configuration with the ``rule-patterns``
directive. This directive utilizes a `TOML`_ `array of tables`_, and thus can
take one of two forms:

Option 1: Keeping it contained in your ``[tool.tartufo]`` table.

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.tartufo]
    rule-patterns = [
        {reason = "RSA private key 2", pattern = "-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----"},
        {reason = "Null characters in GitHub Workflows", pattern = '\0', path-pattern = '\.github/workflows/(.*)\.yml'}
    ]

Option 2: Separating each rule out into its own table.

.. code-block:: toml

    [[tool.tartufo.rule-patterns]]
    reason = "RSA private key 2"
    pattern = "-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----"

    [[tool.tartufo.rule-patterns]]
    reason = "Null characters in GitHub Workflows"
    pattern = '\0'
    path-pattern = '\.github/workflows/(.*)\.yml'

.. note::

    There are 3 different keys used here: ``reason``, ``pattern``, and ``path-pattern``.
    Only ``reason`` and ``pattern`` are required. If no ``path-pattern`` is
    specified, then the pattern will be used to scan against all files.

.. _entropy-exclusion-patterns:

Entropy Exclusion Patterns
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Entropy scans can produce a high number of false positive matches such as git
SHAs or MD5 digests. To avoid these false positives, you can use the
``exclude-entropy-patterns`` configuration option. These patterns will be
applied to and matched against any strings flagged by entropy checks. As above,
this directive utilizes an `array of tables`_, enabling two forms:

Option 1:

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.tartufo]
    exclude-entropy-patterns = [
        {path-pattern = 'docs/.*\.md$', pattern = '^[a-zA-Z0-9]$', reason = 'exclude all git SHAs in the docs'},
        {path-pattern = '\.github/workflows/.*\.yml', pattern = 'uses: .*@[a-zA-Z0-9]{40}', reason = 'GitHub Actions'}
    ]

Option 2:

.. code-block:: toml

    [[tool.tartufo.exclude-entropy-patterns]]
    path-pattern = 'docs/.*\.md$'
    pattern = '^[a-zA-Z0-9]$'
    reason = 'exclude all git SHAs in the docs'

    [[tool.tartufo.exclude-entropy-patterns]]
    path-pattern = '\.github/workflows/.*\.yml'
    pattern = 'uses: .*@[a-zA-Z0-9]{40}'
    reason = 'GitHub Actions'


There are 5 relevant keys for this directive, as described below.

============ ======== ============================ ==============================================================

.. regex-exclusion-patterns:

Regex Exclusion Patterns
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Regex scans can produce false positive matches such as environment variables in
URLs. To avoid these false positives, you can use the
``exclude-regex-patterns`` configuration option. These patterns will be
applied to and matched against any strings flagged by regex pattern checks. As
above, this directive utilizes an `array of tables`_, enabling two forms:

Option 1:

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.tartufo]
    exclude-regex-patterns = [
        {path-pattern = 'products_.*\.txt', pattern = '^SK[\d]{16,32}$', reason = 'SKU pattern that resembles Twilio API Key'},
        {path-pattern = '\.github/workflows/.*\.yaml', pattern = 'https://\${\S+}:\${\S+}@\S+', reason = 'URL with env variables for auth'},
    ]

Option 2:

.. code-block:: toml

    [[tool.tartufo.exclude-regex-patterns]]
    path-pattern = 'products_.*\.txt'
    pattern = '^SK[\d]{16,32}$'
    reason = 'SKU pattern that resembles Twilio API Key'

    [[tool.tartufo.exclude-regex-patterns]]
    path-pattern = '\.github/workflows/.*\.yaml'
    pattern = 'https://\${\S+}:\${\S+}@\S+'
    reason = 'URL with env variables for auth'


There are 4 relevant keys for this directive, as described below. Note that
regex scans differ from entropy scans, so the exclusion pattern is always
tested against the offending regex match(es). As a result, there is no
``scope`` key for this directive.
