# Contributing

Everyone is welcome to contribute to GoDaddy's Open Source Software.
Contributing doesn't just mean submitting pull requests. You can also get
involved by reporting/triaging bugs, or participating in discussions on the evolution of each
project.

No matter how you want to get involved, we ask that you first learn what's
expected of anyone who participates in the project by reading these Contribution
Guidelines.

**Please Note:** GitHub is for bug reports and contributions primarily - if you
have a support question head over to [GoDaddy's Open Source Software Slack][slack], or the
[Tartufo Mailing list].

## Answering Questions

One of the most important and immediate ways you can support this project is to
answer questions on [Slack][slack], [Github][issues], or the [Tartufo Mailing list].
Whether you're helping a newcomer understand a feature or troubleshooting an edge case with a
seasoned developer, your knowledge and experience with Python or security can go a long
way to help others.

## Reporting Bugs

**Do not report potential security vulnerabilities here. Refer to
[our security policy] for more details about the process of reporting
security vulnerabilities.**

Before submitting a ticket, please be sure to have a simple replication of the
behavior. If the issue is isolated to one of the dependencies of this project,
please create a Github issue in that project. All dependencies are open source
software and can be easily found through [PyPI].

Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist:

- Create it on our [Issue Tracker][issues]
- Clearly describe the issue by following the template layout
  - Make sure to include steps to reproduce the bug.
  - A reproducible (unit) test could be helpful in solving the bug.
  - Describe the environment that (re)produced the problem.

> For a bug to be actionable, it needs to be reproducible. If you or
> contributors can't reproduce the bug, try to figure out why. Please take care
> to stay involved in discussions around solving the problem.

## Triaging bugs or contributing code

If you're triaging a bug, try to reduce it. Once a bug can be reproduced, reduce
it to the smallest amount of code possible. Reasoning about a sample or unit
test that reproduces a bug in just a few lines of code is easier than reasoning
about a longer sample.

From a practical perspective, contributions are as simple as:

- Forking the repository on GitHub.
- Making changes to your forked repository.
- When committing, reference your issue (if present) and include a note about
  the fix.
- If possible, and if applicable, please also add/update unit tests for your
  changes.
- Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the 'master' branch
  of the projects' repository.

If you are interested in making a large change and feel unsure about its overall
effect, please make sure to first discuss the change and reach a consensus with
core contributors through [slack]. Then ask about the best way to go about
making the change.

## Code Review

Any open source project relies heavily on code review to improve software
quality:

> All significant changes, by all developers, must be reviewed before they are
> committed to the repository. Code reviews are conducted on GitHub through
> comments on pull requests or commits. The developer responsible for a code
> change is also responsible for making all necessary review-related changes.

Sometimes code reviews will take longer than you would hope for, especially for
larger features. Here are some accepted ways to speed up review times for your
patches:

- Review other people's changes. If you help out, others will be more willing to
  do the same for you. Good will is our currency.
- Split your change into multiple smaller changes. The smaller your change, the
  higher the probability that somebody will take a quick look at it.
- Ping the change on [slack]. If it is urgent, provide reasons why it is
  important to get this change landed. Remember that you're asking for valuable
  time from other professional developers.

**Note that anyone is welcome to review and give feedback on a change, but only
people with commit access to the repository can approve it.**

## Attribution of Changes

When contributors submit a change to this project, after that change is approved,
other developers with commit access may commit it for the author. When doing so,
it is important to retain correct attribution of the contribution. Generally
speaking, Git handles attribution automatically.

## Writing Code

### Setting Up A Development Environment

This project uses [Poetry] to manage its dependencies and do a lot of the heavy
lifting. This includes managing development environments! If you are not
familiar with this tool, we highly recommend checking out [their docs][poetry docs]
to get used to the basic usage.

Now, setting up a development environment is super simple! Additional info if you run into trouble: [Poetry Environments]

Step 1: [Install Poetry]  
Step 2: Run ``poetry install``  
Step 3: Optionally Run ``poetry shell``  

Done!

### Code Style

To make code formatting easy on developers, and to simplify the conversation
around pull request reviews, this project has adopted the
[black] code formatter. This formatter must be run against any new code written
for this project. The advantage is, you no longer have to think about how your
code is styled; it's all handled for you!

To make this easier on you, you can [set up most editors][black-editors] to
auto-run `black` for you. We have also set up a [pre-commit] hook to run
automatically on every commit, which is detailed below!

## Running tests

This project support multiple Python versions. Thus, we ask that you use the
[tox] tool to test against them. In conjunction with poetry, this will look
something like:

```sh
$ poetry run tox
.package recreate: /home/username/tartufo/.tox/.package
.package installdeps: poetry>=0.12
...
  py35: commands succeeded
  py36: commands succeeded
  py37: commands succeeded
  py38: commands succeeded
  pypy3: ignored failed command
  black: commands succeeded
  mypy: commands succeeded
  pylint: commands succeeded
  vulture: commands succeeded
  docs: commands succeeded
  congratulations :)
$
```

If you do not have all the supported Python versions, that's perfectly okay.
They will all be tested against by our CI process. But keep in mind that this
may delay the adoption of your contribution, if those tests don't all pass.

Finally, this project uses multiple [pre-commit] hooks to help ensure our code
quality. If you have followed the instructions above for setting up your virtual
environment, `pre-commit` will already be installed, and you only need to run
the following:

```sh
$ pre-commit install --install-hooks
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
$
```

Now, any time you make a new commit to the repository, you will see something
like the following:

```sh
Tartufo..................................................................Passed
mypy.....................................................................Passed
black....................................................................Passed
pylint...................................................................Passed
```

## Contributing as a Maintainer

On top of all our lovely contributors, we have a core group of people who act as
maintainers of the project. They are the ones who are the gatekeepers, and make
sure that issues are addressed, PRs are merged, and new releases issued, all
while ensuring a high bar of quality for the code and the project.

### Issuing a New Release

This process is thankfully mostly automated. There are, however, a handful of
manual steps that must be taken to kick off that automation. It is all built
this way to help ensure that issuing a release is a very conscious decision,
requiring peer review, and cannot easily happen accidentally. The steps involved
currently are:

- Create a new branch locally for the release, for example:

  ```console
  > git checkout -b releases/v2.1.0
  ```

- Tell Poetry to [bump the version]:

  ```console
  > poetry version minor
  Bumping version from 2.0.1 to 2.1.0
  ```

  - Note: All this is doing, is updating the version number in the
    `pyproject.toml`. You can totally do this manually. This command just might
    be a bit quicker. And it's nice to have a command to do it for you. Yay
    automation!
- Update the CHANGELOG with the appropriate new version number and release date.
- Create a pull request for these changes, and get it approved!
- Once your PR has been merged, the final piece is to actually create the new
  release.

  1. Go to the `tartufo` [releases page] and click on `Draft a new release`.
  2. Enter an appropriate tag version (in this example, `v2.1.0`).
  3. Title the release. Generally these would just be in the form
     `Version 2.1.0`. (Not very creative, I know. But predictable!)
  4. Copy-paste the CHANGELOG entries for this new version into the description.
  5. Click `Publish release`!

Congratulations, you've just issued a new release for `tartufo`. The automation
will take care of the rest! ðŸŽ‰
