v2.4.0 - 05 March 2021
----------------------

Features:

* #76 - Added logging! You can now use the `-v`/`--verbose` option to increase
  the amount of output from tartufo. Specifying multiple times will incrementally
  increase what is output.
* Added a `--log-timestamps`/`--no-log-timestamps` option (default: True) so that
  timestamps can be hidden in log messages. This could be helpful when, for example,
  comparing the output from multiple runs.
* #107 - Added a `--compact`/`--no-compact` option for abbreviated output on found
  issues, to avoid unintentionally spamming yourself. (Thanks to @dclayton-godaddy
  for his work on this one)

Bug fixes:

* #158 - The `--branch` option was broken and would not actually scan anything

v2.3.1 - 16 February 2021
-------------------------

Bug fixes:

* Added rust toolchain to allow for building of latest cryptography

Other changes:

* Added no-fetch to code snippets and note about what it does

v2.3.0 - 04 February 2021
-------------------------

Features:

* #42 - Report output on clean or successful scan. Add new `-q/--quiet` option to suppress output
* #43 - Report out of the list of exclusions. Add new `-v/--verbose` option to print exclusions
* #159 - Switched our primary development branch from `master` -> `main`
* Updated BFG refs from 1.13.0 to 1.13.2

v2.2.1 - 02 December 2020
-------------------------

Bugfixes:

* Rev build and release versions to match

v2.2.0 - 02 December 2020
-------------------------

Features:

* #119 - Added a new `--fetch`/`--no-fetch` option for local scans, controlling
  whether the local clone is refreshed before scan. (Thanks @jgowdy!)
* #125 - Implement CODEOWNERS and auto-assignment to maintainers on PRs

Bugfixes:

* #115 - Strange behavior can manifest with invalid sub-commands
* #117 - Ignore whitespace-only lines in exclusion files
* #118 - Local scans fetch remote origin
* #121 - Match rules specified with --git-rules-repo were not included in scans
* #140 - Ensure a valid output folder name in Windows

Other changes:

* #95 - Run CI across Linux, Windows, and MacOS
* #130 - Added references to Tartufo GoogleGroups mailing list to docs
* Fixed testing in Pypy3 and explicitly added Python 3.9 support
* #134 - Documented the release process
* #143 - Updated GitHub Action hashes to newest rev to address https://github.blog/changelog/2020-10-01-github-actions-deprecating-set-env-and-add-path-commands/ where possible

v2.0.1 - 09 October 2020
------------------------

* Fix the Docker build & deploy

v2.0.0 - 09 October 2020
------------------------

* #74, #75 - Rewrote and refreshed the documentation for the new 2.0 usage (via
  #111)

v2.0.0a2 - 05 October 2020
--------------------------

This bugfix release is to take care of a handful of issues discovered during the
initial alpha release for 2.0.

* #68 - Added consistent documentation through the codebase for classes,
  methods, and all other API elements (via #92)
* #90 - Presenting a friendlier error message when there is an error interacting
  with git (via #93)
* #94 - Fix tests that were failing on MacOS (via #97)
* #86 - Treat `tartufo.toml` preferentially over `pyproject.toml` when loading
  config (via #101)
* #91 - Load config from scanned repositories. This functionality previously
  existed in 1.x, but was missed during the rebuild for v2.0. This also resulted
  in a bit of an overall rewrite of config file discovery to eliminate some
  duplicated logic. (via #103)

v2.0.0a1 - 18 November 2020
---------------------------

This is a whole brand new tartufo! It's been entirely restructured, rewritten,
retested, rebuilt, and remade! It's now more extensible, readable, testable,
and usable.

New features include:

* #2 - Verified/approved exclusions are now handled by way of hash signatures.
  * These hashes are created on a combination of the matched string and filename
  where the match was found. They are generated using the `BLAKE2` hashing
  algorithm. (via #61)
* #7 - A working directory can now be specified to clone to when scanning a
  remote repository. (via #81)
* #11 - Removed the `--cleanup` option and added a `--output-dir` in its place.
  Issues are now written to disk only when specifically requested by providing
  an output directory. (via #82)
* #39 - The functionality is now split into sub-commands (via #78) Available
  sub-commands are, for now:
  * pre-commit
  * scan-local-repo
  * scan-remote-repo
* The entire library has been refactored and nearly all logic has been put
  into its most appropriate place. It should now be possible to use this whole
  tool as a library, and not just a CLI application. (via #29, #65, #67, #70)

Bug fixes include:

* #55 - The tests no longer iterate over this repository's history; everything
  has been sufficiently split out to make it more testable without needing to
  look at an actual git history. (via #70)
* #72 - Specifying a non-git path no longer causes an error (via #80)

Other changes:

* Issues found during the scan are now represented by a class, instead of some
  amorphous dictionary (via #29)
  * Further, since a single `Issue` is instantiated per match, the output key
  for the matches has changed from `strings_found` to `matched_string`.
* #25 - Set up full documentation on Read The Docs (via #38)
* #30 - Support for Python 2 has been dropped (via #31)
* #58 - CI is now handled by GitHub Actions (via #59)

v1.1.2 - 21 April 2020
----------------------

* #48 (Backport of #45 & #46)
  * Documented Docker usage
  * Small fixes to Docker to allow SSH clones and avoid scanning tartufo itself
* Docs have been backported from the `master` branch.

v1.1.1 - 13 December 2019
-------------------------

* Fix the docs and pre-commit hook to use hyphens in CLI arguments, as opposed
  to underscores.

v1.1.0 - 27 November 2019
-------------------------

* Support reading config from `tartufo.toml` for non-Python projects
* #17 - A separate repository can be used for storing rules files
* #18 - Read the `pyproject.toml` or `tartufo.toml` from the repo being scanned

v1.0.2 - 19 November 2019
-------------------------

This release is essentially the same as the v1.0.0 release, but with a new number.
Unfortunately, we had historical releases versioned as v1.0.0 and v1.0.1. Due to
limitations in PyPI (https://pypi.org/help/#file-name-reuse), even if a previous
release has been deleted, the version number may not be reused.

v1.0.0 - 19 November 2019
-------------------------

Version 1.0.0! Initial stable release!

* Finished the "hard fork" process, so that our project is now independent of `truffleHog`.
* #13 - Tests are now split into multiple files/classes
* #14 - `tartufo` is now configurable via `pyproject.toml`
* #15 - Code is fully type annotated
* #16 - Fully fleshed out "Community Health" files
* #20 - Code is now fully formatted by `black`

v0.0.2 - 23 October 2019
------------------------

Automated Docker builds!

* Docker images are built and pushed automatically to https://hub.docker.com/r/godaddy/tartufo
* The version of these images has been synchronized with the Python version via the VERSION file
* Gave the Python package a more verbose long description for PyPi, straight from the README.

v0.0.1 - 23 October 2019
------------------------

This is the first public release of `tartufo`, which has been forked off from `truffleHog`.

The primary new features/bugfixes include:

* Renamed everything to `tartufo`
* #1 - Additive whitelist/blacklist support
* #4 - `--pre_commit` support
* #6 - Documented the `--cleanup` switch which cleans up files in `/tmp`
* #10 - Running `tartufo` with no arguments would produce an error
* Added support for https://pre-commit.com/ style hooks
